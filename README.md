I was unable to get the post working in the controller and the public js file. it kept coming back with a 404 error sent from the controller but I was unable to determine the cause of the issue. Since the id in the public js file was displaying the proper id to be sent to the db. I spent far too much time on this issue so I was unable to create a delete function which is one thing I would have liked to do as well. If you can find the error I would really appreciate it if you could let me know so I can fix it and finish the assignment! thank you!
